<h1>What's the Idea behind our name?❤🌈🦋 </h1>
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many people’s mental health and created new barriers for people already suffering from mental illness and substance use disorders.
Children, away from their school, friends, and colleagues, staying at home can have many questions about the outbreak and they look toward their parents or caregivers to get the answer.
 Not all children and parents respond to stress in the same way. Kids can experience anxiety, distress, social isolation, and an abusive environment that can have short‐ or long‐term effects on their mental health.
Elderly people are more prone to the COVID‐19 outbreak due to both clinical and social reasons such as having a weaker immune system or other underlying health conditions and distancing from their families and friends due to their busy schedules.
<h1> Some Important ways to improve mental health💙🤸‍♀️ </h1>

* Exercise is proven to boost your mood, so implement a regular physical routine as part of your day. You don’t have to sign up for a gym membership, unless you want to. Even something as simple as a quick walk around the block can ease your stress and alleviate some symptoms of depression and anxiety. Most medical professionals suggest aiming for at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. 

* Fuel yourself
Eating nothing but junk food doesn’t feel good for your body or your mind. Instead, think about what you eat as fuel for your overall health. Fruits, vegetables, lean meats and carbohydrates that are full of vitamins and nutrients can help your brain function properly. 

* Focus on gratitude
Practicing gratitude is linked to improved happiness, which is something we all want. Try writing down five things you are grateful for each day and see how it makes you feel. 

* Look for the positive
Improve your self-worth by thinking positively instead of focusing on the negative. It’s not always easy to have a positive attitude when life is difficult, but a change in perception can change how you feel about any situation.
